The Taco Town website is a simple yet inviting online platform that introduces visitors to its restaurant. Mainly using HTML and CSS it comprises three web pages linked together using the navigation bar on top. The home page contains a Bootstrap carousel with high-quality photos of mouth-drooling tacos and Mexican dishes. Toward the bottom of the home page is a snippet of where the “about us” information would be included. The menu web page is constructed using a bootstrap table altered to a simple food menu. Lastly, the contact page is purely a page with a form for customers to input their information on whether they would like to get ahold of the restaurant.
